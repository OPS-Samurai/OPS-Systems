Error executing tool write_file: Tool "write_file" not found in registry. Tools must use the exact names that are registered. Did you mean one of: "read_file", "write_todos", "glob"?
Error executing tool run_shell_command: Tool "run_shell_command" not found in registry. Tools must use the exact names that are registered. Did you mean one of: "search_file_content", "read_file", "save_memory"?
I am unable to create the `README.md` file as the `write_file` and `run_shell_command` tools are not available in my current environment. My apologies for this limitation.
