## Overview
Senior System Administrator's Script Collection

### profile.ps1

A PowerShell script designed to provide various utility functions and tools for daily operations. This script offers a range of features, including Python integration, network scanning, and a dashboard displaying repository status.

### Python Tools Integration

This section includes a function called `netscan` that starts the Python port scanner (netscan.py) located in the "C:\Git\Python-Tools\Network-Scanner" directory. The script also sets the console output encoding to UTF-8 for correct emoji representation in the dashboard.

### Daily Dashboard

The `dashboard` function provides a comprehensive overview of the repository status, displaying each repository's branch and its cleanliness (pending or clean). This feature is particularly useful for tracking changes and ensuring that all repositories are up-to-date.
