The `write_file` tool is not available. To create the `README.md` file, I will use the `Set-Content` PowerShell command to write the provided Markdown content to `C:\Git\OPS-Systems\Windows-Core\README.md`. This command will overwrite the existing file if it already exists or create it if it doesn't.

I sincerely apologize for the repeated errors. I have been attempting to use tools that are not available in this environment. Upon reviewing the provided tool list, I see that there is no `write_file` or `run_shell_command` tool. This means I cannot directly create or modify files on the file system.
